# Python based Ad-Hoc Routing
## Description
This Repository provides a python based Ad-Hoc Routing implementation

#### Provided MANET Routing Protocols
- [x] Parrod (own implementation)
#### Possible Additions
- [ ] DSDV

#### Known Issues
- [ ] Conversion of GPS coordinates to Cartesian is missing (required for Mobility Prediction)
- [ ] Mobility Prediction methods are not embedded yet
- [ ] Traffic Generator generates traffic, but no evaluation is implemented (t.b.d. soon!)
