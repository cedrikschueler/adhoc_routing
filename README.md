# Python based Ad-Hoc Routing
## Description
This Repository provides a python based Ad-Hoc Routing implementation

See `Notes` folder for some useful documentation on issues around setup and usage descriptions.

An example experiment setup is provided in `main.py`. 

The usage of json-formatted setup is recommended. This way you can easily extend the code and load different experimental setups from files.

`sudo` privileges are required to allow the routing table module to write and delete IP table entries.
#### Provided MANET Routing Protocols
- [x] Parrod (own implementation)
#### Possible Additions
- [ ] DSDV

#### Known Issues
- [x] Conversion of GPS coordinates to Cartesian is missing (required for Mobility Prediction)
- [x] Traffic Generator generates traffic, but no evaluation is implemented
- [x] ~~Control flags when writing to Linux routing table~~ (Seems fine)
- [ ] Mobility Prediction methods are not embedded yet
- [ ] Provide velocity from GNSSReceiver
